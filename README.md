#Roman to Decimal

In this challenge, you will be given a number in roman numeral form and must print out its integer value.

##More Information

Roman numerals are composed of the capital letters I, V, X, L, C, D, M corresponding to values 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000.
The value of a roman numeral is the sum of each letter's value.

However, Roman numerals are not purely additive.
Instead of using four repetitions of a single symbol (For example, using IIII to represent 4), we instead use IV, which can be read as '5 minus 1'. Similarly, we use XC for 90, CD for 400 etc.
Note there are some restrictions on this. For example, we don't write IM for 999. It should return an error.
